If you notice a commenting system that should be added (blocked), feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/grantwinney/hide-comments-everywhere/issues/new) for it. Include the website where you noticed it, or [create a pull request](https://github.com/grantwinney/hide-comments-everywhere/pulls) with the necessary changes to the "[sites.json](https://github.com/grantwinney/hide-comments-everywhere/blob/master/sites.json)" file, and I'll follow-up as time permits.

If you encounter a bug, and want to attempt a fix (thanks!) you can [open a pull request](https://github.com/grantwinney/hide-comments-in-chrome/pulls) and I'll check it out when I can.

Thank you!
