If you notice a commenting system that should be added (blocked), [open an issue](https://github.com/grantwinney/hide-comments-in-chrome-sites/issues/new) for that. Include the website where you noticed it, or [create a pull request](https://github.com/grantwinney/hide-comments-in-chrome-sites/pulls) with the necessary changes to the "[sites.json](https://github.com/grantwinney/hide-comments-in-chrome-sites/blob/master/sites.json)" file, and I'll follow-up as time permits.

Thanks!
